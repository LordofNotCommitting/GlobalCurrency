Upon installing the mod, all currency used will be a global currency.
**This means you start with 0 global currency.**
All factional dignitas will be preserved in case you want to install this mod mid-save.

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect**

With MCM, you can disable this feature for Public enemy faction - which are Quasimorphic factions, and Civil Resistance. (by default they also use global currency)

Naturally, trade break won't do anything. Unless you disabled this feature for Public Enemy factions, in which case those faction specifically can still trade break you.

Note: You might start with 100 global currency if you assassinated the CEO. Maybe more if you completed some story missions.

If you want to console command global currency, you can "money Magnum x" where x is the amount of currency you want.

Changelog:

v1.1:
I forgot to ref and buying item with global currency actually didn't spawn bought item in your cargo. This is now fixed.
